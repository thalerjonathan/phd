\chapter{Pure functional time-driven ABS}
\label{ch:timedriven}

In this chapter, we pose solutions to the problems outlined in the previous chapter, by deriving a pure functional approach for time-driven ABS using the example of the agent-based SIR model as introduced in Chapter \ref{sec:sir_model}. We start out with a first approach in Yampa and show its limitations. Then we generalise it to a more powerful approach, which utilises Monadic Stream Functions, a generalisation of FRP. Finally, we add a structured environment, making the example more interesting and showing the main strength of an ABS over other simulation methodologies like System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation. The code of all steps can be accessed from the \href{https://github.com/thalerjonathan/haskell-sir}{repository}~\cite{thaler_sir_repository}.
