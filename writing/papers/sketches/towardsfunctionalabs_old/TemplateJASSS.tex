% MAIN TEXT

\section{Test Section 1}
This is a test section.

\section{Test Section 2}
This is a test section.

% Place the main text here. Please use only \section, \subsection, and \subsubsection sectioning commands to structure your text. Do NOT use lower sectioning commands, including \paragraph and \subparagraph

%For bulleted, numbered and description lists the class provides three asterisked environments to replace the standard LaTeX ones: itemize*, enumerate*, and description*. Please use these ones as the standard environment may cause issues with the paragraph numbering system.

%\begin{itemize*}
%     \item 
%     \item
%     \item
% \end{itemize*} 

% hyperlinks (to models, videos, etc.) can be included via the \href command (remember to put \usepackage{hyperref} in the preamble). Check the hyperref documentation for details

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% FIGURES AND TABLES

% Figures should be placed in the desired position within the text. Please follow the template below.
% Figure widths can be set using absolute dimensions (e.g., [width = 12cm]) or relative ones (e.g., [width = 0.8/textwidth]). We strongly suggest to use the latter option, as this allows automatic adaptation to different paper widths

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=????\textwidth]{????}
%\caption{}
%\label{fig:????}
%\end{figure}

% Tables should be placed in the desired position within the text. Please follow the template below

%\begin{table}[!t]
%	\centering
%	\begin{tabular}{????}
%	\toprule
% 	% first line
%	\midrule
%	% tale body	
%	\bottomrule			
%	\end{tabular}
%	\caption{}
%	\label{tab:????}	
%\end{table}

% End of  paragraph numbering. Please leave this untouched

% Please upload the bib file (not just the bbl one) when submitting.
 
\bibliographystyle{jasss}
\bibliography{} % Please set the right name for your bib file
