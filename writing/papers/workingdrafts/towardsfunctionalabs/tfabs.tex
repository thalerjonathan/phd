% Abstract and keywords

\begin{abstract}
TODO: parallelism for free because all isolated e.g. running multiple replications or parameter-variations

TODO: it is paramount not to write against the established approach but for the functional approach. not to try to come up with arguments AGAINST the object-oriented approach but IN FAVOUR for the functional approach. In the end: dont tell the people that what they do sucks and that i am the saviour with my new method but: that i have a new method which might be of interest as it has a few nice advantages.

So far, the pure functional paradigm hasn't got much attention in Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) where the dominant programming paradigm is object-orientation, with Java, Python and C++ being its most prominent representatives. We claim that functional programming using Haskell is very well suited to implement complex, real-world agent-based models and brings with it a number of benefits. In this paper we will introduce the reader to the functional programming paradigm and explain how it can be applied to implementing ABS. Further we discuss benefits and advantages. As use-case we implemented the seminal Sugarscape model in Haskell.

% Start of  paragraph numbering. Please leave this untouched
\parano{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% MAIN TEXT

\input{./tex/introduction.tex}

\input{./tex/background.tex}

\input{./tex/functionalView.tex}

% Place the main text here. Please use only \section, \subsection, and \subsubsection sectioning commands to structure your text. Do NOT use lower sectioning commands, including \paragraph and \subparagraph

%For bulleted, numbered and description lists the class provides three asterisked environments to replace the standard LaTeX ones: itemize*, enumerate*, and description*. Please use these ones as the standard environment may cause issues with the paragraph numbering system.

%\begin{itemize*}
%     \item 
%     \item
%     \item
% \end{itemize*} 

% hyperlinks (to models, videos, etc.) can be included via the \href command (remember to put \usepackage{hyperref} in the preamble). Check the hyperref documentation for details

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% FIGURES AND TABLES

% Figures should be placed in the desired position within the text. Please follow the template below.
% Figure widths can be set using absolute dimensions (e.g., [width = 12cm]) or relative ones (e.g., [width = 0.8/textwidth]). We strongly suggest to use the latter option, as this allows automatic adaptation to different paper widths

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=????\textwidth]{????}
%\caption{}
%\label{fig:????}
%\end{figure}

% Tables should be placed in the desired position within the text. Please follow the template below

%\begin{table}[!t]
%	\centering
%	\begin{tabular}{????}
%	\toprule
% 	% first line
%	\midrule
%	% tale body	
%	\bottomrule			
%	\end{tabular}
%	\caption{}
%	\label{tab:????}	
%\end{table}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% APPENDICES
% Put your appendices here. Please use the normal sectioning command, e.g.,
% \section{Appendix A: <title of the appendix>}
% \section{Appendix B: <title of the appendix>}
% ...

% ENDNOTES. Please uncomment the line below in case of notes.
% \theendnotes

% REFERENCES.
% The JASSS bibliographic style file (jasss.bst) is included in the bundle. Please use BibTeX, not BibLaTeX.
% Use natbib commands for references (\citep{}, \citet{}, etc.), not standard LaTeX ones (\cite{}).
% Remember to include the doi and url fields in your bib database. The address field should be included for books.
% Please upload the bib file (not just the bbl one) when submitting.
